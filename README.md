# React Router v4 Config
A custom react-router config I always use for my new react projects

### Preferable

- Use `Switch` instead of component if the nested routes functionality is to be added. Mainly Excluding Root file.

##

First install all dependencies
```
npm install
```

Then run it on localhost:3000

```
npm start
```
